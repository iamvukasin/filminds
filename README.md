## Getting started

### Front-end

Before building and running the project, make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Now, you have to install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/):

```bash
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

And then move to the project's root folder and install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

If you want to run the project, just type:

```bash
gulp serve  # or: npm serve
```
